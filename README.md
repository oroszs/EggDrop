# EggDrop
The latest builds of EggDrop for Windows and Mac. This is an arcade-style game I created with Unity featuring custom art, animation, and carefully crafted gameplay mechanics.

(If playing on Mac, you will see a warning message when attempting to open the file because I am not a Verified Apple Developer. You will need to maunally allow permissions to open the app in General Settings. I apologize for the inconvenience).
